0.4.0-1
Sat, 01 Dec 2007 20:06:24 -0300
* Fixes bugs in drivers/Cpan, utils and core.
* Repos definitions can specify the level at which they're cleaned.
* New -x option: between normal and dry run, downloads databases, but just 'touchs' the files, saving time when trying some new features or repos.
* Deletes files if they're bigger than they should.
* Repo locking, so no two instances update the same repo.
* New -s/--size option calculates the size of each processed repo (but doesn't do it).
* Cleaner reports.
* driver/OpenOfficeOrg supports math, hyphenation and theasaurus files.
* New -w|--wipe option does the cleaning step only, deleting files that should not be (anymore?) in the repo. 
* New -y|--download-databases option forces the databases to be downloaded, even it they shouldn't.
