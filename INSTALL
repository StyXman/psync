psync depends in the following packages:
* curl.
for Debian repos:
    * python-apt (python2.3 only)
for Yum repos:
    * yum
    * rpm-python
    * python-celementtree

if you plan to use psync under ubuntu, where the default python is 2.4, you
must run the setup.py script with python2.3.

if you want to use if you:
0) install it running the setup.py script. it's a standar distutils script, so
   you know the drill.
1) copy the `psync.config.py' file to the root of the mirror and modify it at
   will.
2) psync.py --help.
3) fire at will.

I guess that's all. enjoy.
