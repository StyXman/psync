psync is a tool for maintaining mirrors for several types of repos.
right now the status is beta, which means that it works, it  has important
things like, configurability and CL options, but is not considered final.

it depends in the following packages (debian only):
* curl.
* python-apt.

if you want to use if you:
0) install it in the root of the mirrors.
1) modify the `psync.config.py' file.
2) ./psync/py --help.
3) fire at will.

I guess that's all. enjoy.

TODO:
* Release's
